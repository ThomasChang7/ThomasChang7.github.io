	<p align="center"><strong>What is a Squat?</strong></p>
	<p>
		Based on a definition found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)">Wikipedia</a>, the squat is a compound, <em>full body exercise</em> that trains primarily the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, quadriceps muscle, hamstrings, as well as strengthening the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body. 
	</p>
	<blockquote><i>"The squat is the perfect analogy for life. It's about standing back up after something <strong>heavy</strong> takes you down."</i></blockquote>
	<p align="center">Why Squat?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Muscular Strength -</strong>
			The squat will without a doubt improve muscular strength. It will obviously improve lower body strength but in addition to this, it will also improve upper body strength due to the amount of muscle required to keep the body upright and stable under huge amounts of weight. 
		<li>
			<strong>Bone Density -</strong>
			Bones will react to the stress induced on the body from resistance by getting denser. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Burn Fat -</strong>
			Squatting is a highly metabolic movement and it will shred calories as a result of the muscle groups involved (just some of the biggest muscle groups in the body).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Natural Movement -</strong>
			The squat is a natural movement and most people in this world have done it as an infant.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Mental Strength -</strong>
			The squat can be a brutal. Squats can be hard. However, doing such difficult things build mental strength and leads to discipline. The character built through such a touch exercise will positively affect other parts of your life. So <strong>squat</strong>.

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Weightlifting Shoes -</strong>
			A pair of weightlifting shoes will have an elevated heel and allow the lifter to be very stable throughout the lift. The elevated heel will assist in bringing in a deeper squat. It also allows for a more upright posture.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Knee Wraps/Sleeves -</strong>
			These two very similar yet different accessories will without a doubt assist in the development of the squat. The knee wraps will allow the lifter lift more weight in the squat. The tightness of the wraps will allow for higher amounts of elastic energy be stored and released back in the legs during the upward phase of the movement. Knee sleeves on the other hand will provide compression which will induce bloow flow to the knee and reduce pain and swelling during and after the workout. This allows for faster recovery.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Weighlifting Belt -</strong>
			Belts come in both velcro and leather versions. The main function of the belt is to assist in bracing the core and protecting the back. This is essential when it comes to heavier lifts.

		This is a website with a detailed overview on squats. There are some html tags I do not recognize such as span. I assume span is more of an advanced technique and ties into usage with styles. Also I noticed how the non-breaking space was used frequently on this page after certain punctuation marks.
